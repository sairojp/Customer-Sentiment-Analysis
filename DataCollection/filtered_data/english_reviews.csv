A Google user,"bad app design. too many animation for it's own good. very little feature and for some reason, pages like connected device load/update slower than vianet does. whitelist/blacklist isn't intuitive at all. why does my list of whitelisted device delete if I choose filtering to none. How hard is it to save that list for future use? there is no usage graph like vianet does. my frustration with app is very high.",1,2025-03-06 19:40:52
A Google user,"WorldLink Support Team, I hope this message finds you well. I recently upgraded to the new WorldLink app and have noticed that it no longer allows access to router settings and controls, a feature that was available in the older version of the app. This functionality was extremely useful for managing and monitoring my network efficiently. Could you please clarify if this feature has been removed or if there is a new method to access router settings through the updated app? If the feature",1,2025-01-20 20:10:56
A Google user,"This app is so bugged. I tried MAC filtering and when saving the changes, the 'please wait' box takes 5mins to finish and when it finishes, 90% of the time it says 'something went wrong'. It provides so little customization over our router. I absolutely hate it. Worldlink does not even allow us to access our router's settings through ONT (that 192.168... thing) to get around this problem. Oh and customer support is the worst it makes you more frustrated without solving any problems.",1,2023-05-27 20:21:03
A Google user,"The internet service is worst. Its a marketing scheme where everything goes fine for a couple of days. After that, everything starts to go downhill. The network speed drops drastically. Even this app stopped working and I can't use it on my phone. Over the years, I have reported these problems several times to their helpline numbers and to their office but to no avail. If this goes on, I will have no choice than to switch to a new ISP as soon as my worldlink package ends .",1,2022-11-07 18:42:15
A Google user,"The app is too slow that I can't even explain. Many bugs to be sorted out like active clients feature doesn't work properly. As we can't access the router directly, the app provides very irritating experience for the management. To see, it's easy but when we get into it, we won't be able to work properly with it. Needs a lot of improvements.",1,2021-05-15 18:38:53

A Google user,"If there was minus rating, I would have given that. They offered a scheme of one month free if 3 months payment is done, they didn't added the extra one month, now 3 months has expired, they asked to pay for one month and then only would add the extra one month. I did pay for another one month, but still the problem prevails. I also visited the office several times, but they didn't respond to my query. It's very irresponsible for such a huge company.",1,2022-06-16 18:13:26
A Google user,"The service has recently become terrible. The network quality has degraded significantly, and despite multiple complaints, the issue remains unresolved. It's been days with no improvement. I can barely use the service I’m paying for, and customer support has been unhelpful. What’s the point of an internet provider if it can’t deliver reliable service when needed? Very disappointed with the current state. I don't think I'll ever recommend worldlink to anyone.",1,2024-10-15 06:51:46
A Google user,"Takes excruciatingly long time to change a simple setting on a device that's just 1ft away from me. A task that's typically under a minute. - Doesn't have all the settings you might need - Wifi is randomly turned off sometimes when changing other settings - You're in a deadlock if you don't have Ethernet. Need internet to turn on wifi, need wifi for internet access. - This feels like buying a packet of noodles, but having to call CG group support to open the packet, because security.",1,2021-06-14 07:48:30
A Google user,"Very inconsistent. Sometimes it works, often it doesn't. Menus and many other items don't respond often times. Doing anything more than bare minimum is a hassle as the app freezes or crashes. Search is basically useless, can't click on results.

A Google user,Worldlink is the worst decision I have ever made in terms of network connection. The connection goes out itself. Even the app is not working since a very long time. I have been trying to reach out the customer service but the customer line is always busy. Tried to reach them via WhatsApp but that is totally waste of time too. Do I need to visit office to fix my problem? I see no way other.,1,2022-01-20 13:40:09
A Google user,"Worst app i have to face daily. Whenever i blacklist or whitelist or remove from those lists, it says error and does the thing after some hours. Cannot keep 2 password for my two ssid, cannot change wifi security type and it ain't blocks qr password share. I just don't know why was the app made. This is the only thing which makes me to think if i should leave worldlink.",1,2023-04-13 20:56:49
A Google user,"Device filtering not working properly. It only add one device to Blocklist. And if I tried second one to Blocklist then automatically it switch to none filter mode. Similarly to the whitelist, if I tried to add further 7/8 devices then automatically switch to none filter mode if tried to add device. My Document are mis handle. There is no useful things, if net is down , app won't work offline and can't report via app. I will review back if they correct issue until then 1 star is enough for app",1,2023-10-14 12:23:29
A Google user,"Worst customer service. Have to explain the same problem repititively to 10 different people. App is useless, doesn't work, cannot even change password from the app. When I reported the problem to customer support, they guided me to 'change the password from the app'. If it was working, I would've done it myself. Then they change password from their end without even informing me what the new password is going to be. Support representatives don't come at the time given to us. 0 rating.",1,2021-10-12 17:26:41
A Google user,It looks like some sort of marketing scheme. The internet is pretty good when it's connected new but as time goes and you get the yearly package (which you can't cancel once activated and looks cheaper) the service gets worse and worse. No matter how many calls you make or how many mails you write they don't fix the problem.,1,2021-09-02 12:33:52
A Google user,"I'm using 175 mbps package and the service absolutely sucks, the CS barely address to right issues. It's always the same problem, slow upload... what's the use of internet when the subscriber can't even surf websites properly. Worst is the app... It barely have any needed customizable option... No good features on whitelist or blacklisting the devices.. tales me out of connection everytime I try to filter something.... Service providers are making a fool out of us subscribers.

A Google user,Worst app. Half the time the app doesn't even open and when it opens it doesn't function as it's supposed to.

If you are making everything in app blocking router page at least do it properly,1,2023-08-29 15:29:05
A Google user,It's lacking far too many settings. If you're not going to allow us to access the router page then at least add most of the important features and not just some simple ones like password change. Making your customers contact customer support to change a few minor settings is tedious for us as well as your employees.,2,2023-06-15 21:03:07
A Google user,"ISP (Interrupted Service Provider) acting like a middleman, Customers should be able to opt in to accessing the admin panel of the router located at their homes, this app handicaps users such that users need to install secondary router just to filter devices when the primary router has that feature (app shows it doesn't) Even an ADSL router from 10 years ago had that feature. Appends wlink to user names for promotion like they gave us the wifi for free and wifi is slow as hell.",1,2020-08-13 21:08:20

If you don't fix mac filtering issues which i am facing a lots while blacklisting unknown devices, i will shift to other... they provides full authority/access to me to enter router through ip.

The app has a lot of potential and can prove to be really helpful, but it has a few bugs in it that render it quite annoying.

I'll be switching to other ISPs this September, 2021. 1) The support mobile number in their official contact us page doesn't work anymore. 2) It takes 10 attempts to connect to a call. Even then, the call disconnects abruptly instead of holding customers in queue. 3) My connection was cut 15 times even after I paid a one year fee 1 week in adavance. They termed it as Accounting issue and it was resolved only after calling the support team EVERYDAY FOR 20 DAYS. 4) Connection fails to establish for 15-20 minutes after every electricity cut. 5) Too fancy mobile app that doesn't load in slow/normal data connection",1,2021-06-22 12:22:30

A Google user,It's a nice app. The concept is good but there are some errors. The data provided while doing speed test is inaccurate. Also if we extend 3 days then they will cut more than 3 days after we pay for one month subscription.,3,2022-07-22 18:36:40

A Google user,Fix this app or else remove it !!! What the uses of this app when it doesn't even works ? It's been 10 days + and this app is not even functioning it only shows worldlink rather than that it doesn't even works. Fix it ASAP.

But  there  are  some  Thing  missing  which  makes  it  an  incomplete app .. My  suggestion  is  to add  some features listed  below . -Allow  us features of  MAC add  filtering to disconnect  or  block  unwanted   devices .. -There  is  a topic  ( Connected Devices ) But  when  we  click  on  it  , It doesn't  show any  of  the  connected devices  rather  it says   (No Resources Found) .So  this  problem  should  also  be fixed..  -And  one  probem  is  that  I  have  blocked some  sites  like  adult content , Hacking Sites but  it  is  running  using  my  network .And  this  should   also  be  fixed ..  I   want to Suggest  MyWorldlink app's  developer &  designer   team  to  review  and solve  this problem ..

A Google user,Biggest mistake that there is no longer control by user. When ever we have to change their SSID and Password it doesn't support and problem is that we have to reset their router and restart the setting again for SSID AND PASSWORD.

A Google user,"World Link Sucks!  I have been using World Link services for more than two years now. But, after I shifted to 6mbps unlimited plan, World Link showed it true fraudulent colors!  What is Unlimited? Unlimited means ‘unlimited’, plain and simple! But, in World Link’s dictionary, Unlimited means Limited, just like volume based plans. If u use internet a bit more than average users, then RIP your high-speed internet experience (which is already way slower than they claim) because they will throttle your internet speed! If unlimited connection is a limited connection with fallback speed, why would I choose unlimited plan? I would certainly choose Volume Based Service!  In its website and advertising, World Link never mentions that unlimited is not really unlimited! So, since they deceive users into taking this expensive plan without mentioning their fraudulent policy, known as Fair User Policy (FUP), which, without mentioning any details tells that “IF you use too much internet, we will throttle your internet speed”. How much is too much? What volume of use is too much? Nothing is mentioned. It simply means, pay for unlimited plans, but don’t use unlimited, always be limited with your use! It is like a King announcing to his people – “You have the complete democracy, but you can do only what I allow you to do!”  I have 45 days left in my 3 months plan, and they have completely crippled my bandwidth! When asked, they told I used more that a certain volume. Shame on you, World Link! I have lost all my faith and trust on this fraudulent ISP. I will be dumping its crappy service once this contract is over. Well, it might sound like cheap move if I request people to stop using World Link Unlimited Service, but at least, as an aware costumer, I would like to inform this in public interest that the World Link Unlimited Connection is just a limited plan with higher price! So, consider this before your connect to them!",1,2017-02-19 22:14:26
